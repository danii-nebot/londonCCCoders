Made for [London Climate Change Coders](http://www.meetup.com/London-Climate-Change-Coders/)

Simple restful API to be called by a Google Spreadsheet script. It uses the Meetup API documented at http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/ to automatically collate the group members' details.

This information is already not private to the group and is publicly visible by anyone browsing our meetup group.  The aim of the spreadsheet is to provide climate change organisations with a quick overview of the skills of the people in the group, so that they can determine whether there is anything they think we could work on for them. It's also nice for the group to be able to look at what other group members do and think.

Made with [Meteor.js](http://www.meteor.com) and [reststop2](http://github.differential.io/reststop2/)
