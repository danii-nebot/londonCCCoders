      This meteor project hosts an ultra simple API made for the <a class="alert-link" href="http://www.meetup.com/London-Climate-Change-Coders/">London Climate Change Coders</a> group.
      </p>

      <p>
      This API is to be called by a Google Spreadsheet script. It actually proxies the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/" class="alert-link">Meetup API</a> to automatically collate the group members' details.
      </p>

      <p>
      This information is already not private to the group and is publicly visible by anyone browsing our meetup group.  The aim of the spreadsheet is to provide climate change organisations with a quick overview of the skills of the people in the group, so that they can determine whether there is anything they think we could work on for them. It's also nice for the group to be able to look at what other group members do and think.
